# choix

This is a Python library for research on choice models. The goal is encourage
reproducible research in the area of preference learning.

**This is work in progress.** At the moment, only the Bayesian inference module
(`bayesinf`) is more or less ready for consumption. Check out the [relevant
notebook](choix/notebooks/ep-example.ipynb) for an example.
