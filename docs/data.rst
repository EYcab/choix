Types of Data
=============

Three types of data


.. _data-pairwise:

Pairwise comparisons
--------------------

blablabla


.. _data-rankings:

Rankings
--------

Items are expected to be represented by consecutive integers from ``0`` to
``n-1``. A (partial) ranking (see :ref:`data-rankings`) is defined by a tuple
containing the items in decreasing order of preference. For example, the tuple
``(2, 0, 4)`` corresponds to a ranking where ``2`` is first, ``0`` is second,
and ``4`` is third.


.. _data-top1:

Top-1 lists
-----------

blablabla
